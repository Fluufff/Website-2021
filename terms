</ul>
<h4>Payment via Stripe (Bancontact, credit and debit card)</h4>

				<h1 class="block fs--50 lnh-150 m-b-0.5x m-t-2x" id="dealers">Dealers' Den terms and Conditions</h1>
				 <p>
To ensure a smooth and pleasant Dealer’s Den for everyone, we ask you to respect the following terms and conditions.
</p>
<ol>

<li>This goes without saying, but be courteous and polite towards the other artists and attendees.</li>
<li>A table and seating will be provided free of charge. Additional tables and other materials will also be provided free of charge, but may be in limited supply. Materials will be provided on a first come, first serve basis. (E.g, if you ask for stuff a week before the convention, we might be unable to fulfill that request.)</li>
<li>You are completely responsible for any and all financial transactions you happen to make in your position as artist in the dealer’s den. This concerns the calculation of added taxes (if applicable), keeping your money safe, etc. We recommend that you set up some kind of online payment option for your customers (for example, a paypal account) as it’s safer and more practical than cashboxes.</li>
<li>The original creator of your merch must always be obvious (i.e. no plagiarism). You may resell art/merchandise, but label it appropriately, especially if you’re selling it along with your own creations.</li>
<li>There are regular non-attendees in the building who could potentially stumble into the convention space. For this reason, we ask that all your openly displayed material is SFW only. You are free to sell NSFW material as long as it’s not openly displayed, put it in a folder or map or something like that. For extreme fetish material (vore, gore, inflation,diaper, watersports, etc) we recommend that you label the container appropriately. Illegal content or merchandise is explicitly forbidden.<br>
The final decision on these matters rests with the Dealer’s Den team. In case of doubt, ask the Dealers' Den team ahead of time via the <a href="https://fluufff.org/profile/contact/">contact form</a>.</li>
<li>We’d kindly request that you keep activism to a minimum. The Dealers Den is not a political forum, your table is not a recruitment office. Slogans/stickers/symbolism without added artistic value will are not allowed.</li>
</li>
<p>
A violation of these terms will result in a verbal warning from the Dealer’s Den Team. Should you continue to violate the terms in spite of this warning, you may be banned from the Dealer’s Den for the remainder of the convention.
