				<h2 id="terms">Terms and Conditions</h2>
				<p>These terms and conditions apply to all attendees of the convention.</p>
<h2>Registration and Payment</h2>
<p>In order to take part in the convention, you are required to register through our online registration system and purchase the tickets from there. Tickets purchased through any other means are not valid.</p>
<h3>Screening</h3>
<p>Registrations are subject to screening by registration staff.</p>
<h3>Payment methods</h3>
<p>We currently accept payments through bank transfer, Credit Card (Visa, Mastercard), and Debit Card (Bancontact, Maestro). No other means of payment are accepted.</p>
<h4>Payment by banktransfer</h4>
<p>The first payment for an invoice is due within 10 calendar days after you have selected the payment by banktransfer.</p>

<p>If we do not receive proof of payment within ten days after the payment method has been selected your slot is no longer guaranteed and may be cancelled.</p>

<p>We also permit payment in maximum 3 installments up to two month before the convention, for payments of more than 120€.</p>
<ul>
    <li>First installment has to be paid within ten days.</li>
    <li>All installments have to be paid within two months or at the latest one month before the convention, whichever comes first.</li>
    <li>If the payment is not completed by this date the booking will be cancelled without any refund.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Payment via Stripe (Bancontact, credit and debit card)</h4>
<h3>Rooms assignment</h3>
<p>The registration team reserves the right to rebook the attendees in different rooms should all rooms be taken, and if empty spots in some would remain. The price difference (should there be one) will be refunded.</p>
<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>Non-staff attendees registering before the official registration date, may get banned from the convention and registration reserves the right to refund your registration costs.</p>
<h3>Delivery</h3>
<p>An email will be sent to you with a confirmation when everything has been paid in full.</p>
<p>You can always access the account page and print out your confirmation, check the payment status for your invoices and print your invoices.</p>
<h2>Age Verification</h2>
<p>Attendees must be at least 18 years old at the first day of the convention. As this is an adult convention, we won't do any exception for minors.</p>
<p>Attendees are required to present their legal photo ID, driver licence or passport at check-in time. Your ID details must match the information in our electronic records.</p>
<h2>Cancellation/Ticket Transfer</h2>
<h3>Cancellation</h3>
<p>Tickets (including all fees, extras and hotel rooms booked through us) are not refundable.</p>

<p>However, tickets (including all extras and bookings attached to them) can be transferred. Both parties must send an e-mail to registration@fluufff.org using the e-mail they signed up with, along with their registration number, and confirm the transfer.</p>
<p>Registration staff will then update the database accordingly</p>

<p>Note: Ticket transfers must be cleared by us ahead of time in all cases. Any person showing up at the convention who is not in our database will not be admitted in someone else’s name.</p>
<h3>Event Cancellation</h3>
<p>In case the event is cancelled, all payments to Flüüfff (ticket, hotel) will be refunded, with the possible exception of processing fees and organisation costs. Any other expenses, such as travel costs or other expenses not with Flüüfff, will not be refunded under any circumstances</p>

<h2>Sponsorship</h2>

<h2>Terms of Conduct</h2>
<p>These rules and guidelines apply to all attendees of the convention.</p>
<p>Flüüfff likes to present itself as a professional convention of friendly, respectful, and open-minded members of the furry community and their friends.

				<h2 id="dealers">Dealer's Den terms and Conditions</h2>
				 <p>
To ensure a smooth and pleasant Dealer’s Den for everyone, we ask you to respect the following terms and conditions.
</p>
<ol>

<li>This goes without saying, but be courteous and polite towards the other artists and attendees.</li>
<li>A table and seating will be provided free of charge. Additional tables and other materials will also be provided free of charge, but may be in limited supply. Materials will be provided on a first come, first serve basis. (E.g, if you ask for stuff a week before the convention, we might be unable to fulfill that request.)</li>
<li>You are completely responsible for any and all financial transactions you happen to make in your position as artist in the dealer’s den. This concerns the calculation of added taxes (if applicable), keeping your money safe, etc. We recommend that you set up some kind of online payment option for your customers (for example, a paypal account) as it’s safer and more practical than cashboxes.</li>
<li>The original creator of your merch must always be obvious (i.e. no plagiarism). You may resell art/merchandise, but label it appropriately, especially if you’re selling it along with your own creations.</li>
<li>There are regular non-attendees in the building who could potentially stumble into the convention space. For this reason, we ask that all your openly displayed material is SFW only. You are free to sell NSFW material as long as it’s not openly displayed, put it in a folder or map or something like that. For extreme fetish material (vore, gore, inflation,diaper, watersports, etc) we recommend that you label the container appropriately. Illegal content or merchandise is explicitly forbidden.<br>
The final decision on these matters rests with the Dealer’s Den team. In case of doubt, ask the Dealers' Den team ahead of time via the <a href="https://fluufff.org/profile/contact/">contact form</a>.</li>
<li>We’d kindly request that you keep activism to a minimum. The Dealers Den is not a political forum, your table is not a recruitment office. Slogans/stickers/symbolism without added artistic value will are not allowed.</li>
</li>
<p>
A violation of these terms will result in a verbal warning from the Dealer’s Den Team. Should you continue to violate the terms in spite of this warning, you may be banned from the Dealer’s Den for the remainder of the convention.
